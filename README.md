# Etch-A-Sketch

This github project is made regarding the ***Odin Project curriculum***.

## Overview

This website allows you to draw an image using pixels.

### Current state

For now you have 16x16 grid where you can draw by hovering the tiles.

### Future enhancements

I don't plan on wasting too much time on this project but here are the upgrades this project would need :

- Option to choose the size of the grid from a 2x2 size to a 64x64 grid.
- Option to select the color.
- Option to download the drawing.
